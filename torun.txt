In order to run the project, you will need python installed and the Pillow image library.
To start, type 
python main.py
at a terminal. You have the option to include command-line parameters to specify the way in which the graphics will be implemented, as follows:
1. If no parameters are provided, the graphics are disabled.
2. If you use the command line flag -g with no extra arguments, the default graphics behavior (output only to file) will be enabled.
3. If you would like other graphics parameters, you can specify an argument to the -g flag, which can contain any of the following characters:
a. f - enables output to image files in the current directory
b. s - automatically opens the default image viewer with the current frame
c. d - debug output of the last frame to a csv file (not really intended for use)

Examples:
To launch the simulation with graphics output to file, enter
python main.py -g
To launch a simulation with automatic graphics output and files, enter
python main.py -g fs

Once you have launched the simulation, you must answer some questions about the specific simulation parameters you would like to use. The program will prompt you for input and provide examples. Follow all instructions to launch the simulation.
