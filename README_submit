Project Description

_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

We created a simulation of a marine ecosystem. The ecosystem contains marine organisms and simulates the relationships between these organisms. We also simulate a couple of natural processes that occur in such ecosystems.

The project primarily uses object polymorphism and separate threads to represent organisms or groups thereof. There is a central ecosystem class which contains the shared state of the ocean and stores data and functions allowing organisms to read and affect changes to the ocean.

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN CODE

_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

In the terminal, run:
	python main.py [optional arguments]
Then follow the onscreen prompts to choose the number of ticks the simulation should run for, the size of the ocean, and how many of each organism to populate the ocean with.

[optional arguments]
-g f # outputs graphics to files starting frame0.jpg - frameN.jpg
-g s # generates temp files that open as the simulation runs
-g d # outputs a large csv file of all pixel rgb values

Directory & Files explanation

_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

main.py
contains the main function, which prompts the user for input, retrieves it, instantiates an Ecosystem with the appropriate parameters, and starts the simulation
imports ecosystem and all of the organisms (used for allowing the user to decide how many of each organism to populate the ocean with)
ecosystem.py
contains the definition of the Ecosystem class
imports all of the organisms, seablock, location, foodchain, as well as Lock, Barrier, and with_lock (a helper function) for synchronization.
seablock.py
contains the definition for the SeaBlock class
imports Set, with_lock, and Lock
foodchain.py
contains the definition for the Foodchain class
location.py
contains the definition for the Location class
organism.py
contains the definition for the Organism class
imports threading, random, location, and helper_functions
fish.py
contains the definition for the Fish class
imports random and organism
barrier.py
contains the definition for the Barrier class
graphic_output.py
contains the definition for the graphicsOutput() function, which can be used to create an image of each tick of the simulation
helper_functions.py
contains definitions for two helper functions, with_lock and random_pick
with_lock was taken from the class notes
random_pick was taken from Python Cookbook, 2nd Edition: http://bit.ly/1QfSwDs
Files that contain class definitions for our organisms. All of them inherit from either Organism or Fish:
coccolithophores.py
grouper.py
herring.py
shark.py
shrimp.py
starfish.py
tuna.py
