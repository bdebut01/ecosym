Notes about the development process for use in the final report (because we have
to talk about a difficult bug, etc)

Bugs:
-- Needed to call barrier.wait() when a organism died before it ended the thread
-- Were trying to override start() function when we actually needed to override 
run() function
-- Not exactly a bug, but had to get the order of stuff write with organisms
getting to the barrier and the ecosystem printing statuses (ended up using
phase1 v phase2)
-- Size of orgsList Set was getting changed in the middle of loop, so we added
a lock

-- BEN SWAPPED THE ORDER OF Organism constructor arguments, beware!!
	-> (he did this because he needed to make location argument optional)

-- EATING:
    -- a predator might try to eat an organism when it's asleep or in the middle
       of an action. To deal with this, when a predator calls prey.beEaten(), it
       just sets the prey's wasEaten variable to True. At the beginning of each
       loop, an organism checks if it wasEaten and if it was, it dies or
       decrements its population
