Notes about the development process for use in the final report (because we have
to talk about a difficult bug, etc)

Bugs:
-- Needed to call barrier.wait() when a organism died before it ended the thread
-- Were trying to override start() function when we actually needed to override 
run() function
-- Not exactly a bug, but had to get the order of stuff write with organisms
getting to the barrier and the ecosystem printing statuses (ended up using
phase1 v phase2)
-- Size of orgsList Set was getting changed in the middle of loop, so we added
a lock

-- BEN SWAPPED THE ORDER OF Organism constructor arguments, beware!!
	-> (he did this because he needed to make location argument optional)
